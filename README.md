Experiment 1 :Introduction to python

Aim:      To undertsand the basics of python pragramming and write simple programs.


Theory:   1)Type function-> Used to identify the data type
          2)Arithmetic operator-> Used to do mathematical calculation for a expression
          3)Import-> Used to import the required function froma a module block
          4)If-else loop -> Used to create a loop and check condition , for the program to be executed
          5)Comparison Opetator ->Used to compare any boolean or literal values.

Algorithm:1)To declare multiple variables and assign values to them {All in a single line}
          2)Use of type function to identify the data types of values assigned to a variable
          3)Utilization of arithmetic operators and exponential asterisk
          4)Use of import funtion for math module
          5)Usage of math module for area,logarithmic and other mathematical functions via math module
          6)With the help of if-else loop identify which number is greater via the utilization of comparison operator

Conclusion: With This one can conclude or interpret the basic understanding of python
